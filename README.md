⚠️ Notes & Considerations (Critical Review)

To keep expectations realistic and robust:

Meta AI’s DOM structure may change; automation can break when they update the UI

Meta may introduce rate limits or automation detection

Some users only need a small number of outputs; this tool targets high-volume creators

Download formats may differ (MP4/PNG/GIF), and behavior may vary

Workflow assumes linear generation; some Meta AI outputs require retries or manual selection

🛠️ Troubleshooting

If the panel does not appear, refresh Meta.ai

Ensure Chrome is updated

Make sure Developer Mode is enabled

If downloads stop midway, check your internet stability

If Meta AI changes layout, the extension may need an update
