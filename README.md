## ⚠️ Notes & Considerations (Critical Review)

-   Meta AI's DOM structure may change; automation can break when they
    update the UI\
-   Meta may introduce rate limits or automation detection\
-   Some users only need a small number of outputs; this tool targets
    high-volume creators\
-   Download formats may differ (MP4/PNG/GIF), and behavior may vary\
-   Workflow assumes linear generation; some Meta AI outputs require
    retries or manual selection

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

-   If the panel does not appear, refresh Meta.ai\
-   Ensure Chrome is updated\
-   Make sure Developer Mode is enabled\
-   If downloads stop midway, check your internet stability\
-   If Meta AI changes layout, the extension may need an update
